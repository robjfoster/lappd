    Baseline Correction with Asymmetric Least Squares Smoothing

    October 21, 2005

    Description from the original documentation:

    Most baseline problems in instrumental methods are characterized by a smooth
    baseline and a superimposed signal that carries the analytical information: a series
    of peaks that are either all positive or all negative. We combine a smoother
    with asymmetric weighting of deviations from the (smooth) trend get an effective
    baseline estimator. It is easy to use, fast and keeps the analytical peak signal intact.
    No prior information about peak shapes or baseline (polynomial) is needed
    by the method. The performance is illustrated by simulation and applications to
    real data.

        y:
            input data (i.e. chromatogram of spectrum)

    Baseline correction using asymmetrically

    Abstract

    Baseline correction methods based on penalized least squares are successfully
    applied to various spectral analyses. The methods change the weights iteratively
    by estimating a baseline. If a signal is below a previously fitted baseline,
    large weight is given. On the other hand, no weight or small weight is given
    when a signal is above a fitted baseline as it could be assumed to be a part
    of the peak. As noise is distributed above the baseline as well as below the
    baseline, however, it is desirable to give the same or similar weights in
    either case. For the purpose, we propose a new weighting scheme based on the
    generalized logistic function. The proposed method estimates the noise level
    iteratively and adjusts the weights correspondingly. According to the
    experimental results with simulated spectra and measured Raman spectra, the
    proposed method outperforms the existing methods for baseline correction and
    peak height estimation.

    Description from the original documentation:

    Baseline drift always blurs or even swamps signals and deteriorates analytical
    results, particularly in multivariate analysis.  It is necessary to correct
    baseline drift to perform further data analysis. Simple or modified polynomial
    fitting has been found to be effective in some extent. However, this method
    requires user intervention and prone to variability especially in low
    signal-to-noise ratio environments. The proposed adaptive iteratively
    reweighted Penalized Least Squares (airPLS) algorithm doesn't require any
    user intervention and prior information, such as detected peaks. It
    iteratively changes weights of sum squares errors (SSE) between the fitted
    baseline and original signals, and the weights of SSE are obtained adaptively
    using between previously fitted baseline and original signals. This baseline
    estimator is general, fast and flexible in fitting baseline.
